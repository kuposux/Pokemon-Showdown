//     - id: Specifies an id for the group.
//     - name: Specifies the human-readable name for the group.
//     - root: If this is true, the group can do anything.
//     - inherit: The group uses the group specified's permissions if it cannot
//                  find the permission in the current group. Never make the graph

//     - jurisdiction: The default jurisdiction for targeted permissions where one isn't
//                       explictly specified. "Targeted permissions" are permissions
//                       that might affect another user, such as `ban' or `promote'.
//                       's' is a special group where it means the user itself only

//                       lower in rank than the current group.
//   All the possible permissions are as follows:
//     - lockdown: /lockdown and /endlockdown commands.
//     - hotpatch: /hotpatch, /crashfixed and /savelearnsets commands.
//     - ignorelimits: Ignore limits such as chat message length.
//     - promote: Promoting and demoting. Will only work if the target user's current
//                  group and target group are both in jurisdiction.
//     - ban: Banning and unbanning.
//     - mute: Muting and unmuting.
//     - receivemutedpms: Receive PMs from muted users.
//     - forcerename: /fr command.
//     - forcerenameto: /frt command.
//     - redirect: /redir command.
//     - ip: IP checking.
//     - alts: Alt checking.
//     - broadcast: Broadcast informational commands.
//     - announce: /announce command.
//     - modchat: Set modchat.
//     - potd: Set PotD.
